                        I've had both New York and Chicago style pizzas. Both are not only great, but really popular. Also, I love ordering pizza from Dominos and I love going to
                        Pizza Hut(they even have sit down restaurants). Additionally, there are a lot of television shows where the main characters love to eat pizza too.
                        Here are some of the most popular types of pizza, some of the most popular pizza brands and more. Thanks for visiting my portfolio project.

                      Personally, New York style pizza is one of my favorite types of pizza. It's thin, but the slices of pizza are wider than Chicago style Pizza.
                        It also makes for a great meal at a party. Itâ€™s the type of pizza that's seen all of the time in shows
                         like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

                      Chicago style pizza is also one of my favorite types of pizzas too. Chicago style pizza is a deep dish style
                       pizza that has extra cheese and tomato sauce. I usually have less slices of Chicago style pizza because
                       the pizza is more of a meal. Chicago style pizza is more thick than New York style pizza.

                      In an article on the Business Insider's website, it says that 36% of people order pepperoni on their
                      pizza(Lutz, "Here's A Pie Chart Of The Most Popular Pizza Toppings"). Pepperoni is one of my favorite types of pizza toppings.

                      Sausage is one of my favorite toppings for pizzas too. According to Business Insider,
                      it's the second most popular topping for pizza. Fourteen percent of people ordered sausages on their pizzas
                      (Lutz, "Here's A Pie Chart Of The Most Popular Pizza Toppings"). Also pepperoni is technically a type of sausage too.
