                      In Home Alone, Kevin McCallister loves eating pizza. Kevin orders an entire pizza for himself in both movies(which is amazing
                        since he's around 10 years old). His family also loves pizza too, which is shown when they ordered about 10 pizzas.

                      In Spider-Man, Spider-Man also loves to have Pizza. In the newest Spider-Man game, Spider-Man takes a break
                       from defeating villains by eating some pizza. In some of the older Spider-Man games, Spider-Man delivers
                       pizza as a fun mini game.

                      In the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV shows, the turtles love to eat pizza(especially Michelangelo).
                      They usually have the New York style pizza because they live in the sewers of New York. They love having pizza parties
                      and even share the pizza with Master Splinter too.

                    The NFL is sponsored by Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut has commercials with top players like Juju Smith-Schuster,
                    Aaron Donald and Todd Gurley in it. They even made a YouTube video about a pizza party that Juju had with
                    some of his Pittsburgh Steelerâ€™s teammates. Not only that, but pizza is a great meal to have at Super
                    Bowl parties too.
